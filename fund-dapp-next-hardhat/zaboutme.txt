for work this project completly we have to do following more steps;
1)i think in .env we put rpc-url of rinkeby network not alchemy
2) in client>components>form>components>formRightWrapper
    correct the ipfs url according to our cotract 
    currently we used from infura.io 
3) in index file inside getStaticProps function check rpc-url
4) inside form>Form.js in startCampaign function check CONTRACT_DEPLOYED_ADDRESS =NEXT_PUBLIC_ADDRESS
